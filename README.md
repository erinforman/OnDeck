# about the developer

Erin's inspiration for this app came from wanting to solve 3 problems:

1. Saving bucket list travel destinations alongside the resource or person that recommended them.
2. Effortlessly creating itineraries that take the most efficient route between destinations.
3. Sharing itineraries and resources with friends.

This app is <i>basically</i> scientifically proven to increase happiness: [What a Great Trip! And Iâ€™m Not Even There Yet - NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/travel/what-a-great-trip-and-im-not-even-there-yet.html).

<strong>Generate</strong> a latitude and longitude for urls for travel destinations, like travel blogs, city features in magazines, and restaurant websites, using the Google Geocoding API. Save destinations to a postgres database via SQLAlchemy, which the Google Maps API uses to generate individual markers.
